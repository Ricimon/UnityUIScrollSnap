# UnityUIScrollSnap

**This is a work-in-progress.**

An extension to the Unity UI system that allows for scrolling and snapping to child elements.  
This can be used to create paginated scroll views.

Much of this code is inspired by UnityUIScrollSnaps by Beka Westberg https://bitbucket.org/beksomega/unityuiscrollsnaps/src/master/  
  
But I decided to roll my own solution with fewer features but a friendlier scripting interface.
